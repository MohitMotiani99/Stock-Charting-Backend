# Stock-Charting-Backend


VERY IMPORTANT NOTE --->    FILES UPLOADED ARE SAVED IN `resources/static/StockPriceData` IN `StockPrice` service, IF IT GIVES ERROR WHILE UPLOADING NEW FILE ,FOR NOW WE WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE THE PATH TO THE CORRESPONDING FOLDER MANUALLY IN `StockPrice/service/StockpriceImpl` in the `UPLOAD_DIR` VARIABLE, CURRENTLY WORKING ON RELATIVE PATH HANDLING,WILL COMMIT WHEN SUCCESSFULL.


Backend for the Stock Market Charting Case Study:-

Made in Java Spring Boot in Microservice MVC Architectures including packages(entity/document,controller,service,dto,exception & repository for all the Microservices)

Microservices include:-

- Service Registery

- Companies

- Stock Exchanges

- Sectors

- Users

- IPOs

- Stock Price (for all the charting related APIs)

- API Gateway




BASIC STEPS:--



- Start service Registery first

- And then all other services

- API gateway is also present

- 6 Microservices + Service registery + API gateway

- MongoDB Atlas Used with Hibernate
